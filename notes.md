## what are interfaces, classes and objects and how do they relate in java

In Java, an interface is a blueprint for a class. It defines a set of methods that a class must implement, but does not provide any implementation for these methods. An interface is defined using the interface keyword, and it can contain only method declarations and constant variables.

A class is a template for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors of an object. A class is defined using the class keyword, and it can contain method definitions, variables, and constructors.

An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity in the real world, and it has its own state and behavior. Objects are created using the new operator, and they can access and modify the properties and behaviors defined in their class.

Here's an example of how these concepts might be used in Java:

// Define an interface
interface Animal {
  void makeSound();
}

// Define a class that implements the Animal interface
class Dog implements Animal {
  private String name;
  private int age;

  public Dog(String name, int age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Woof!");
  }

  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  public int getAge() {
    return age;
  }
}

// Create an object of the Dog class
Dog myDog = new Dog("Fido", 3);

// Use the object to call the makeSound() method
myDog.makeSound();

In this example, the Animal interface defines the makeSound() method, which must be implemented by any class that implements the interface. The Dog class implements the Animal interface and provides an implementation for the makeSound() method. The Dog class also has its own properties (name and age) and behaviors (the getName() and getAge() methods). The myDog object is an instance of the Dog class, and it can access and modify the properties and behaviors defined in the Dog class.

what are Polymorphism, encapsulation and inheritance and give code examples in java

Polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance are important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP).

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In Java, polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding.

Method overloading is the ability of a class to have multiple methods with the same name, but with different signatures. For example:

class Calculator {
  public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  }
  
  public double add(double a, double b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

In this example, the Calculator class has two add methods that have the same name, but different signatures. The first add method takes two int arguments and returns an int result, while the second add method takes two double arguments and returns a double result. This allows the Calculator class to perform the same operation (adding two numbers) on different data types.

Method overriding is the ability of a subclass to provide a different implementation for a method that is already defined in a superclass. For example:

class Animal {
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Some generic animal sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  @Override
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Woof!");
  }
}

In this example, the Animal class has a makeSound() method that prints a generic animal sound. The Dog class extends the Animal class and overrides the makeSound() method to print a specific dog sound. This allows the Dog class to reuse the code from the Animal class, but provide a different implementation for the makeSound() method.

Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and behavior inside a single unit (such as a class). It is used to protect the data from external access and modification, and to promote modularity and code reuse. In Java, encapsulation is achieved through the use of access modifiers (such as private, protected, and public).

For example:

class BankAccount {
  private String accountNumber;
  private double balance;
  
  public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double balance) {
    this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
    this.balance = balance;
  }
  
  public String getAccountNumber() {
    return accountNumber;
  }
  
  public double getBalance() {
    return balance;
  }
  
  public void setBalance(double balance) {
    this.balance = balance;
  }
}

In this example, the BankAccount class has three variables: accountNumber, balance, and owner. The accountNumber and balance variables are marked as private, which means they can only be accessed and modified by methods within the BankAccount class. The getAccountNumber() and getBalance() methods are public, which means they can be accessed by any code that has a reference to a BankAccount object. The setBalance() method is also public, but it allows the balance to be modified. This encapsulation allows the data and behavior of the BankAccount class to
