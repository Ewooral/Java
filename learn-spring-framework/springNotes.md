# Coupling
is how much work is involved in changing something.
Coupling is important everywhere
    E.g. An engine is `tightly coupled` to a Car
    * A wheel is `loosely coupled` to a Car
    * You can take a laptop along everywhere you go. It is not
      `tightly coupled` to a specific place
    * A computer made up of a monitor, system unit, keyboard and mouse
      is a bit difficult to move.
